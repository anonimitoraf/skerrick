#+TITLE: Notes

* Test Suite
- [ ] Make it easy to visually map the input lines of code -> output lines
* TODOs - Server
- [X] Fix exports: bindings being repeated N! times
- [X] Support importing of built-ins (e.g. ='fs'=)
- [X] Auto-evaluation of dependencies (e.g. starting from =index.js=)
  - [X] Test if cyclic deps are supported
  - The problem here is that the Skerrick needs to be able to access all the files of the project.
    - Either, Skerrick is started as part of the project OR
    - The editor sends Skerrick the files it needs to evaluate - 2 way comms needed
    For now, I'll support the former since it seems easier to do. Actually, the latter might not be feasible. Imagine having to send MBs of node_modules files across the wire!
- [-] Support commonjs modules [5/17]
  - [X] module.exports = { x: 1 }
  - [X] module.exports.x = 'something'
  - [X] exports.x = 'something'
  - [X] require('ns')
  - [ ] require.resolve
  - [ ] require.cache
  - [ ] require.main
  - [ ] module.children
  - [ ] module.filename
  - [ ] module.id
  - [ ] module.isPreloading
  - [ ] module.loaded
  - [ ] module.path
  - [ ] module.paths
  - [ ] module.require
  - [X] Auto-eval of cjs stuff. At the moment only es6 ones get auto-eval
  - [ ] Clean up of exports. At the moment, intermediate values stay in the namespaces
- [X] Support dynamic imports
- [X] Check behavior of native libs - is special consideration needed?
- [ ] Typescript support
- [ ] Stack traces
* TODOs - Emacs
- [X] JSON outputs are showing up as plists
- [X] Overlays should disappear on movement
- [X] Support result truncation
- [ ] Create a minor-mode
- [ ] Focus stdout/stderr buffer on eval, when needed
* TODOs - VSCode
- [X] Command to start/stop server
- [X] Support result truncation
- [X] Focus stdout/stderr buffer on eval, when needed
- [ ] Icon
* Document caveats
- Normal execution: error when undefined identifier vs Skerrick: No error
